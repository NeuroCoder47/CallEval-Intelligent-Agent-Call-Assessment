![CallEval Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300.png?text=CallEval+Banner) <!-- Replace with your project banner -->

## üìñ Description

**CallEval** is an innovative web application designed to assess agent calls intelligently. Leveraging advanced audio transcription and natural language processing, CallEval helps businesses evaluate their agent's performance by answering crucial questions based on the conversation. This project utilizes the Whisper model for transcription and the T5 model for analysis, providing insightful feedback on agent interactions. By automating the evaluation process, CallEval enhances productivity and facilitates training for agents, ensuring better customer service experiences.

## üìà Objectives

- **Enhance Performance**: Provide agents with feedback to improve their performance based on recorded calls.
- **Streamline Evaluation**: Automate the analysis process to save time for managers and trainers.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilize AI to gather actionable insights from call transcriptions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure ease of use with a simple, intuitive web interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **Audio Upload**: Upload call recordings in MP3 or M4A format effortlessly.
- **WAV Conversion**: Convert audio files to WAV format using FFmpeg for better compatibility with the transcription model.
- **Automatic Transcription**: Transcribe audio files into text using the Whisper model, ensuring high accuracy.
- **Conversation Analysis**: Analyze the transcription to evaluate agent performance based on predefined criteria, such as policy adherence and effectiveness.
- **Downloadable Outputs**: Easily download converted WAV files, view transcriptions, and read analysis results for further examination.
- **Session Management**: Utilize Streamlit's session state to keep track of user inputs and results across different interactions.
- **Customizable Evaluation Criteria**: Modify the analysis questions based on specific business needs or training requirements.
